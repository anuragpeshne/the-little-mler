### The First Moral
Use `datatype` to describe types. When a type contains lots of values, the
datatype definition refers to itself. Use 'a with datatype to define shapes.

### The Second Moral
The number and order of the patterns in the definition of a function should match
that of the definition of the consumed datatype.

### The Third Moral
Functions that produce values of a datatype must use the associated constructors
to build data of that type.

### The Fourth Moral
Some functions consume values of star type; some produce of star type.
